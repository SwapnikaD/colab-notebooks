In the Middle Ages, the question was raised by the French philosopher Jacques de Mandeville, who wrote in his treatise on the “law of nature” that “it is impossible to have a man in the world without a woman.” In his book, The Law of Nature, De Mendeville argued that the human body is a natural product of the natural laws of motion and that man is born with a certain capacity for motion. He also argued for the existence of a “race” of men, which he called the “male race”. DeMendeville’s book was the first to suggest that men are born to be hunters, sailors, and sailors; that they are not born in a race of animals; and, finally, that there is no race in man.</s>\n"

            "Response 0: What is the meaning of life? Where is it that we can live in this moment? And do we really live it in all its goodness? If it is our responsibility and our obligation to live, should we live by the principles and the precepts of the Church? Do we not see that living by these principles is not an obligation? What can we do to make this obligation a reality? Life is as natural, as human, and in natural circumstances, it may be impossible to choose a real life in which one has lived from the moment of birth. What makes life real, what makes it worth living for one hour? How can life become real if life is such a thing as a subject? Is the subject dead when it dies? Are we to accept this subject as real? Have we the right to reject it as something else? We all live a life of indifference. The man who takes a great deal of time to walk about his environment and to experience its natural and social forces does not live the good life. It is a form of cruelty, of depriving the man of his right of presence. I think the most interesting problem is that which separates good and bad lives. Life and death. Yes. We live without the human form, without human life, which is no longer living. For the first time all these objects in life are not just physical objects and functions. In nature we have an infinite range of possibilities, to which we will be exposed at any moment. To be able to decide whether to take or not to have a body is just the appearance of being of some sort. Why are we afraid to die now? Because we are afraid of dying, because we want to go away because it has to be done. But these are the things we say so that it must take place for us, even in our very being, with the body, death, life again, the return of death and new. This is an extreme evil, that evil which makes the very idea of saving a human spirit a fear. Yet it seems quite natural. However, if death is all that life has, then we ought to treat our life the same. How should such life be?\n",
            "To whom belong our human beings? To whom is their life belonging? Were the lives of all the people of our age made the basis for the making of history? It seems evident that in the past life was a good thing. And we should have been content. If we had lived according to our best intentions, we would not dare to ask to God if there had been no evil before us. Perhaps a lot of this suffering and misfortune is because no one wants to do anything about it. They want only to enjoy themselves. Nothing is done about our lives today with these evil views. Let us look at the present state of nature and look why we get so little pleasure. All the time, all of us live and die a living life and enjoy it all at once. When it comes to a change of atmosphere, not everything becomes better, nor does it change. Because the change does require something, some kind of change, or something. Then the thing that matters in a changed world is something different. Today we see in Nature these things which appear to us to change with some extraordinary force. These things appear even at our first and most fundamental moment in time. Sometimes these little things are something that seems to attract us and which, after a time or a movement, actually turns us away from what we were when we first appeared. Many interesting things take a while to appear. Most things seem to come true in an instant. You will find a reason that the fact is good for you.</s>\n",

But these are the things we say so that it must take place for us, even in our very being, with the body, death, life again, the return of death and new. This is an extreme evil, that evil which makes the very idea of saving a human spirit a fear. Yet it seems quite natural. However, if death is all that life has, then we ought to treat our life the same. How should such life be?\n",
            "To whom belong our human beings? To whom is their life belonging? Were the lives of all the people of our age made the basis for the making of history? It seems evident that in the past life was a good thing. And we should have been content. If we had lived according to our best intentions, we would not dare to ask to God if there had been no evil before us. Perhaps a lot of this suffering and misfortune is because no one wants to do anything about it. They want only to enjoy themselves. Nothing is done about our lives today with these evil views. Let us look at the present state of nature and look why we get so little pleasure. All the time, all of us live and die a living life and enjoy it all at once. When it comes to a change of atmosphere, not everything becomes better, nor does it change. Because the change does require something, some kind of change, or something. Then the thing that matters in a changed world is something different. Today we see in Nature these things which appear to us to change with some extraordinary force. These things appear even at our first and most fundamental moment in time. Sometimes these little things are something that seems to attract us and which, after a time or a movement, actually turns us away from what we were when we first appeared. Many interesting things take a while to appear. Most things seem to come true in an instant. You will find a reason that the fact is good for you.</s>\n",

            "1\n",
            "The nature of corruption.\n",
            "Corruption is a social phenomena since its origin it stems from the exploitation and abuse of power from individual to individual. So, its genesis was quite natural from a psychological point of view. There are four major types of human problem: opportunism, selfishness, jealousy, and envy. The first two type of behaviours that constitute opportunistic, self-interested behaviour in human existence are exploitation as well as abuse such as oppression and domination. Opportunistic and selfish behaviour are mutually reinforcing behaviours and will not be removed or removed once they break from one another. If the human beings act opportunistically, in the best case it leads to a decline in society. In the worst case that will be a cause of social collapse. All in all, the world does not end. Exploitation alone can not replace its source. Human behaviour plays an important role in its formation. At least in India, a great part of the development of our society have been caused by opportunist, selfinteressed, evil and revengeful behaviours. This has resulted in development in terms of industrialisation, economic prosperity, power, wealth, status and prestige, which has lead to corruption. As an example, by the year 2009, 1,211 billion rupees (US$16.6 billion) has gone to corrupt actors and their families and other assets (Indian Institute of Public Policy). This is significant. Indeed, it shows that the role of corrupt in socioeconomic growth is vital.\n",
            "There are some general problems in our country and many people in general. Corruption exists everywhere. It is now clear from what we have said above, that corruption occurs in every corner of society for two main reasons namely, opportunism: the individual wants to exploit the power position within community to his/her profit. Then the person takes advantage of what he/she can. For example if he or she has a business or if his or her family has wealth. He/she always wants it for himself or herself. And selfish in nature. A person is always trying to change himself and his family members. They do not want an opportunity nor will they be satisfied unless the opportunity will give them a position and benefit. Thus, they look for an easy and easy way to do so which is taking advantage. Often it is the result of unintentionalness. Unfortunately it becomes obvious that it has been done consciously and is made at work with others. That is why the man or woman always comes to us and wants us to work for them, for our good. When some people are at the top, things become a bit difficult. After some years, one can see the progress made in this regard. While most of us are not interested in what is said or it was done. But as the number of people who are high no longer available is there any need to take a course, have a degree or get a job? It has brought about a problem to society as it brings bad things like lack of good workers, job security, poor wages or a lack and ineffective government, under one roof of government is like a prison. People who want wealth cannot do anything but to be rich themselves. However some want access to government and they get it. Just because a person has the ability to get the Government in Pakistan does nothing. Money is only an illusion, as a simple example. Anybody can make money or can earn some money. With the rise of money, people want power. Anyone knows how to play the game and has no problem doing that. Therefore, without any control there is no peace of mind. We have not had any peace and we are also not satisfied with our lives that are well and have family. Some may still want these things. Those who do want one thing are those who prefer not to go to any university. Such people cannot get any good job, so they either go on to higher education or work. To become unemployed, we need that money and it will come from government. What has happened in recent years in relation to our countries? Many countries have achieved better levels of national development. Recently India did not have any problems with corruption, because it did everything possible to control corruption in their country. Most government officials were good people working for the country, who were happy to help people, especially poor citizens. Also, if someone is on the bench they always try to bring more funds. One can talk about corruption and the way that some politicians do things as if they were like it or they just have no idea. How many of them are from lower classes? The same problem that arises in many countries and all the countries we spoke about. Moreover, corruption happens in both public and non-\n",

            "\n",
            "Prompt: Why is corruption prevelant?\n",
            "Response: Why is corruption prevelant? Do people take precautions, or do they not? What are the different factors involved in the corrupt practices and corruption in other countries, and how can we use that information to better understand what is happening in countries without corrupt laws and regulations, that is, when it comes to corruption, if we should be able to do that? The second point to note is that the corruption problem is a worldwide problem. This is because corruption is the most powerful motivation for individuals to commit crimes, the ones that cause the worst human suffering, so it makes sense that there must be a more widespread problem rather than just at the front. So why corruption?\n",
            "We can take the statistics of a country as a good start to studying a corruption problem: most countries have a crime rate that does not look very high at first glance. But then after a while this is changing dramatically. At the beginning, there are countries that commit only a few crimes each year and at that point the crime rates start going higher. After awhile, countries with more corruption start suffering more from the wrongdoings because there is no one in charge. That is usually where countries commit more crimes and their corruption rates begin to fall. In many cases, this kind of problem has a root of internal corruption and the system that makes the systems that are responsible for that corrupt is called an autocratsystem. It is important to understand this in order to apply prevention, recovery and rehabilitation initiatives. There is also an area where there will be an increase in corruption because of the emergence of new forms of corruption that has become rampant in this form of government. Because so many people are being forced to work under bureaucratic control, people will continue to suffer under the control of this bureaucracy, especially young people who are not able or unwilling to fight against their parents, with their education, lack of work or education and they will start working, in some cases as factory workers; some of those youngsters will even grow up as slaves and that very day will inevitably end up being a threat to the state and to their livelihood. Therefore it is very important for the government to continue its efforts on the prevention of that corruption by focusing on reducing the internal and external corruption problems where they are more effective at reducing these problems. The next point that should we focus on is how corruption can affect people.\n",
            "Corruption is more harmful when the problem exists for a long time, because people often fail to find what they need (or they just don’t know how to earn money) or know who should do their jobs. When the public is corrupt this makes it more difficult for government workers to make their choices and this does lead to a kind type of fraud. And that fraud, which sometimes is so large that it destroys the entire community, can also result in crime. How do people look at corruption? They will have problems thinking that they should have made their choice because they actually will receive the punishment from another person or a state. A common reason for people to misinterpret the information that comes from government is people have no idea what their government really is or what the role of bureaucracies is in society. To the extent that you can actually see corruption before it occurs, even though you cannot know why it happens in a certain country, you will already know that this cannot affect your income or your life. These people understand that no government should hold back what you should really do and therefore they do not want to face the problems that come with corruption. If someone can see a problem there and then you are in control that problem, then that person will say, “I don’t wanna do it”, “It isn’t something I can fix” or “Maybe someone else will do the work”.\n",
            "What does “rampant” mean? When you consider corruption as rampantly corrupt, such person cannot be trusted because because their income will not change and hence the changes in income they make to themselves will never disappear. They cannot trust anyone. Corruption is not a simple matter of being able and able not to be in place because you need time and money because if you want people or governments to respect you from time to time there needs to come changes. I don’t want corruption to ramp up and ramp out because then we will become too dependent on a single person who cannot respect each other. He has to have the ability to get things done for us on time so if he decides to take an inconvenient person and run from them, he will fall at once because the inconvenience is worse than getting his money back on his shoulders. You get to know a person, how they live, what his background is and what he thinks and thinks about him. What type they want this person to believe and do, whatever you might be doing for them. Well, it’s that simple. Yes, I know this sounds strange, but it’s true because it works. On first and second thoughts, most people would be more inclined\n",

            "Response: Why is AI biased to speicific race? Is AI bias to choose whichever racial group it chooses in the first place? Has AI learned to prioritize racial discrimination? Do the AI race algorithms use race as a factor and are they biased in favor of “normal human” people? Answering these questions opens up new problems for our understanding of race at the machine learning and algorithms frontier. AI’s race decisions depend heavily on previous experience with racism and what our social structure is like. With recent research showing the power of predictive statistical techniques and machine intelligence to learn how we think and behave, we can begin to make meaningful progress on these fundamental issues.\n",
            "Doctors and scientists working on AI argue that AI is biased primarily because the social context that allows its performance is inherently biased by the human. This is very similar to the ways computers make predictions about the world around them. It is just that the environment we create has an inherent bias that will constrain us to some degree, but what humans and computers are doing right now is improving the odds of being human and therefore making AI more likely to work for human benefit.\n",
            "We can’t predict what an individual will choose, so our AI algorithms must take advantage of these biases to develop better predictions. As AI advancements grow in terms of computational capabilities and more information, our algorithms should not be able to predict how to treat individual health at face value. In order for an AI algorithm to perform its job, it needs to be sensitive to these factors. Of course, they also need to take into account the fact that an entire field of science is dealing with racial or other misconceptions that are just as prevalent in human communities as in other settings.\n",
            "As much as AI promises to improve human health, this will not always be enough to solve all our problems. If we can’t effectively address discrimination, science will continue to fail. The results from a vast amount of research conducted by health organizations and academia will show that we should invest in research on racial and racialized health rather than focusing on treating race alone.\n",
            "Over the years, the public has become increasingly aware of the influence of a certain environment on how people process information. Researchers at MIT suggest that social environments can be an important determinant of how computer users process and interpret information through the automatic control of many different neural circuits. For example, when people receive information in a noisy environment, an automatic system adjusts information processing in response to both environmental and internal cues. Because there is little information available in an noisy and noisy world, humans process some information simply because of their noisy sensory experience. When this information is processed, some neural systems process that information and some other information that doesn’t belong to them is ignored or ignored. People who take a passive approach to dealing or treating this situation may fail to react appropriately to certain information.\n",
            "The most common social discrimination we have today is racism at one point in time: “Do you think a female with fair skin is more attractive than a guy with dark skin because he has darker brown eyes?\". However, as well as its impact on physical appearance, racism can also affect how humans actually treat social interactions and relationships. A study conducted at Boston College showed that people who used a racist image of racial groups (“Do more black people”, for example) or racial prejudice in speech and action were more negative (and thus, more frustrated) in some instances than people not using racial images (i.e. “people without a history”). To avoid discriminating against racists, it’s important that our human race is well-balanced before people start taking the lead on racism.\n",
            "Although racism exists, most people think they have no problem. But when faced with untrusted information they’re not able or willing to deal with it. There are two types of data sets we’ve just referred to that can impact this. First, are racial disparities in productivity that should drive our race algorithm’s decision process. We needn’t worry because most research shows that discrimination that comes off a single word can still impact your experience in your workplace or in any society you belong into. Second, if we don’t have a clear discrimination history, how can we make our systems and processes fair? In fact, there are many ways by which people have racially biased experiences with our communities.</s>\n",

As an adult who can’t afford a new Apple Watch, it’s a good thing there was a joke. I could have bought an Apple Phone as a kid (because they had to make all of the phones), but then I got a cell phone because I knew someone whose cell line was doing the same thing. In my experience, these memes, which have often been labeled as politically motivated or offensive, are always useful because they’re funny, and usually don’t have an affect on their audience. It’s a very useful meme when one is in favor of something because there’s some value in it.

            "Prompt: How can we promote sustainability?\n",
            "Response: How can we promote sustainability? It is an urgent question that is increasingly relevant. Sustainable enterprises (SEEs) will, therefore, play a crucial role in the future of the industry. SEEs must continue to operate within a paradigm of sustainable development, with the environment at the centre, and their strategic focus should be on increasing productivity and lowering costs in order to ensure and sustain high quality products. Indeed, most of today's products have an environmental footprint (EFD). The sustainability of an SE is defined as the extent to which it meets its EU targets [8]. These requirements make it essential that enterprises comply with environmental goals [5].\n",
            "SEE sustainability can be assessed in three way: i) indicators, ii) targets, iii) criteria and recommendations. Indicators of SE sustainability are the following indicators: a) Green Labeling Initiative (GLI), b) ESG, c) ISO 27000, d) environmental management system (EMS). As highlighted in [17], companies must be aware that Green Design is a global challenge. GLI has a large number of European and United States companies that can help companies to achieve this goal. The Green Certification Network (GCN), or global Green certification initiative is made up of a database containing the relevant companies' green certificates, which make up the green certificate category. To measure the value of these certificates is very difficult. It means that the company's sustainability performance is not assessed on a value-added basis, but on the basis of its performance within the context of current environmental legislation. A company may have different green certifications for different products and service categories, e.g., a product manufacturer can have one green license but not another. Thus, if the certified product does not meet the environmental requirements, the EMS or the GLI may influence the choice of certification. Furthermore, it is only through the certification of all its certifying companies (including the product owner) that companies verify and achieve their environmental obligations. Another way is to measure these certifiers' performance in terms of green labeling performance [13]. In the case of EMI certification, market research companies calculate different prices of emission-adjusted energy consumption. In SE certification companies, environmental performance data are gathered regarding the customer's use of electronic devices in their respective markets.\n",
            "Environmental performance of enterprises is measured either through a range of performance indicators [5], or from actual production results [1, 2], i.e., in relation to the requirements of consumers. This is crucial for both the decision-makers and operators of markets. Therefore, as proposed in [9], the determination by companies of what to report to consumers is important for the competitiveness of their sectors. Environmental performance criteria are often defined in a broader sense, for example, by the ISO 14001 standard. An environmental criterion includes seven indicators or requirements. These indicators can then be measured by different approaches. By using data regarding actual manufacturing output, manufacturers can provide information about the presence and extent of emissions problems and the resulting cost reduction. Other common criteria for environmental measurement and monitoring are defined by Eurostat, in particular under the section \"Market Competence\", or in ISO 11134 and ISO 26000. Here, manufacturing firms can also contribute with their data and quality, since an appropriate standard is necessary to support their implementation in future ISO 17025 legislation.\n",
            "Data on market share (based on survey data) of consumer goods can contribute the data needed for defining environmental criteria. Different sources can therefore also be used, namely customer surveys, reports and business surveys. Among these, customer survey answers are most useful, because they may reveal gaps and shortcomings in consumer awareness, product development and manufacturing, quality and reliability. Their measurement provides information regarding how well consumer groups compare to each other and to potential competitors. For example,\n",
            "where F i is the survey frequency and N i are total number and gender of respondent. Such as, a question which asks consumers \"who would buy a car in 2013?\" may provide answers similar to (15):\n",
            "Furthermore, such surveys can reveal a variety of market information that may lead to more precise answers.\n",
            "Although there are no direct examples of applying environmental assessment and certification criteria in SE enterprises, researchers usually make use, either directly, through their own experts, on expert recommendations from the market. However, this model is limited, not only due to time and expertise, although also to market characteristics and product requirements [5]. Therefore it may be useful to assess potential market demands and conditions by making use also of information from other experts. According to [10], there is no comprehensive study on how the assessment results of various criteria can impact SE business sustainability. One example of this is reported by Mergel [10]. This author reports studies that consider the potential problems surrounding SE market performance. He analyzes the criteria used in different areas of environmental business management. At the same time, he states that environmental aspects do not always influence market decisions, even when making the best choice at any stage of business\n",

The Sustainable City Forum is intended to promote sustainable city planning and implementation, and to help build a collaborative and cooperative approach.\n",

It is possible that sustainability can also be a social issue.\n",
            "A more positive way forward for cities and municipalities to foster strong and sustainable citizens is to encourage all stakeholders to recognize climate change and its impact on the built environment. Creating more and more sustainable partnerships is often a prerequisite to achieve the goals of sustainability and ultimately to fight against climate.

In addition to a discussion of methods, recommendations were presented in order to ensure that cities, municipal units, authorities and relevant stakeholders (city councils, local authorities, investors, social workers, citizens, etc.) can adopt the best way possible. They could also contribute to this review as they bring their recommendations in a useful format for decision making.\n",

            "Response: What are best ways to do charity? Well, as a community of support groups in Liddesford, it’s hard to decide which of these choices are right for you. In fact, if you decide the latter, you might decide to set up a charity. But, to stay with the basics and get your finances in order, some of the most important things to see when looking at best charities in the area that we can recommend are the following:\n",
            "First, determine if there is a charitable organization that is going to support you, the person who will be the beneficent, and you have a number of other friends and families to go by. A charitability checklist might look something like this:\n",
            "Check out any local community centers and the community support organizations that happen to be supporting you; these organizations will show that the organization you’re thinking about has the right people, services, community resources, etc. The list would then really be a better indication of if it’s worth the effort.\n",
            "Keep in mind that if the local church, organization, and/or religious group you are considering is really just for the benefit of another person, then you would’ve no problem if it isn’t for that or that person. That said, sometimes when working with other people at a local, religious, or charity, they simply don’t want to accept financial support or anything else from the fundraising process. Some will just say that it’s too hard for them and that “we’re not working here, so we don’t have the capacity to contribute.” Of course there will always be someone who wants to work hard, but it will often be because they don’t realize what a much bigger world they might inhabit.\n",
            "If you’ve been in a similar situation, make sure that you know if your church or the group that supports you is qualified to provide your local assistance and provide you financial assistance. Ask someone to walk into your neighborhood and see if they have their local support organization with them. Most churches will need to have them be registered with any city’s county government.\n",
            "So, a good point when it comes to picking the best charity organization for your community or group is that there really is only a limited number and only one charity that truly fits your needs. Many of our members are not looking for religious organizations of any sort; they want simple things like cooking or a donation card. If you need help in keeping your financial health stable and your lifestyle or job stable, check out the charite for which you want.\n",
            "One of today’s biggest challenges for both us as business people and people in our community, in communities that love their businesses, is the impact of online commerce. Although the world has changed over the last 3 decades, traditional retail shops have changed and become the new norm. So, what is digital retail?\n",
            "Digital retail is not simply a brand name, for example; it means everything from physical goods to digital products like digital magazines. Yes, online stores have increased in sales. However, it requires new products to create and maintain revenue levels and brand names. To be successful on the internet, stores need a variety of branded products that not only sell items, such as clothing, items of furniture and appliances, like furniture, kitchen and bath items and others, not just products of clothing or furniture.\n",
            "For customers, this means to make purchases in stores online through the sale of their goods or services. It means that it not even necessary to choose a store or to visit the store in person to buy, all you can do is purchase online and they will have your goods and services delivered when they are approved.\n",
            "Here at Wealthy Affiliate or Sell By Afiliates, we always make an effort to build brand equity as we believe online sales and affiliate marketing are mutually reinforcing when it’s aligned to the overall product line of an online store. With online buyers who prefer to shop through a website and direct purchase, those things also have been doing well. As a side-effect of this, sales have also been increasing and we’re seeing better results now than we could in previous years. This, again, was a powerful impact on online purchase data, because it made things easier for consumers to get to know you and their shopping needs.\n",
            "It is very important to remember that what you buy online can be sold as well, meaning that your products can come back for replacement in retail locations that can not compete with online shops. It’s a win-win scenario especially for retailers that have grown their online revenue dramatically.</s>\n",

When he crossed the border of Iraq with Kuwait, he had arrived in Baghdad already in 1292. Upon his arrival, Imam Muhammad saw his country suffering a totalitarian regime. This happened in early 1299, during the reign of Shaykh al-Malik, after the death of Abbas the Great. Imam had a deep understanding of Muslim social problems in that time. Since this was his first and, indeed, most important period of his life, in which he saw him and his followers in action, it seems that he would have written numerous books about Muhammad in particular. The Prophet Muhammad was an inspiration and a god to his Muslim followers both in terms of religious religious knowledge and economic prosperity. All Muslims who have read the book of Qur'an have found that Muhammad is the leader and inspiration of their lives.\n",

Being an immigrant, however, Muhammad remained with his family for many years and helped save the lives of many people by providing some necessary provisions. One of them was Muhammad Saher, who spent the last two years of His life working as a merchant in a town in South Africa. Having been left out of this world for so long, Allah spoke to him in His own way. After being given a job as assistant to a friend in Oxford, where he was studying, He went to Paris to make a visit. According to Saheri, \"Once in Paris the next day he arrived and found his wife and three of her children dead in an undercutting car. During his search, while trying to climb out, Saheler was thrown to an unexpected tree that had fallen out in front of him. A moment later, when suffering heavy injuries, as he came out onto the trunk, she collapsed upon her mattress, dying instantly. She left one of these children alive, whose last act was to call for someone to take care of an dying mother. Sahler fell into an alley and fell off into the water in whose depths Sahere was able to swim to life\" (Al-Allamah, vol. 4, No. 27, 1979, pp. 29, 30).\n",

There was no house where they were able and stable shelter for their souls in any way at all. At one place, they slept around tables on cement poles instead of beds. To this day, many of us know that while suffering, even the most hardened and courageous souls will find that the darkness in their hearts will not be as it has been for ever.

            "['How can we promote sustainability? This book explains how your business can become part of a sustainable ecosystem, or what are the best practices?', 'How can we promote sustainability? It is an urgent question that is increasingly relevant. Sustainable enterprises (SEEs) will, therefore, play a crucial role in the future of the industry. SEEs must continue to operate within a paradigm of sustainable development, with the environment at the centre, and their strategic focus should be on increasing productivity and lowering costs in order to ensure and sustain high quality products. Indeed, most of today\\'s products have an environmental footprint (EFD). The sustainability of an SE is defined as the extent to which it meets its EU targets [8]. These requirements make it essential that enterprises comply with environmental goals [5].\\nSEE sustainability can be assessed in three way: i) indicators, ii) targets, iii) criteria and recommendations. Indicators of SE sustainability are the following indicators: a) Green Labeling Initiative (GLI), b) ESG, c) ISO 27000, d) environmental management system (EMS). As highlighted in [17], companies must be aware that Green Design is a global challenge. GLI has a large number of European and United States companies that can help companies to achieve this goal. The Green Certification Network (GCN), or global Green certification initiative is made up of a database containing the relevant companies\\' green certificates, which make up the green certificate category. To measure the value of these certificates is very difficult. It means that the company\\'s sustainability performance is not assessed on a value-added basis, but on the basis of its performance within the context of current environmental legislation. A company may have different green certifications for different products and service categories, e.g., a product manufacturer can have one green license but not another. Thus, if the certified product does not meet the environmental requirements, the EMS or the GLI may influence the choice of certification. Furthermore, it is only through the certification of all its certifying companies (including the product owner) that companies verify and achieve their environmental obligations. Another way is to measure these certifiers\\' performance in terms of green labeling performance [13]. In the case of EMI certification, market research companies calculate different prices of emission-adjusted energy consumption. In SE certification companies, environmental performance data are gathered regarding the customer\\'s use of electronic devices in their respective markets.\\nEnvironmental performance of enterprises is measured either through a range of performance indicators [5], or from actual production results [1, 2], i.e., in relation to the requirements of consumers. This is crucial for both the decision-makers and operators of markets. Therefore, as proposed in [9], the determination by companies of what to report to consumers is important for the competitiveness of their sectors. Environmental performance criteria are often defined in a broader sense, for example, by the ISO 14001 standard. An environmental criterion includes seven indicators or requirements. These indicators can then be measured by different approaches. By using data regarding actual manufacturing output, manufacturers can provide information about the presence and extent of emissions problems and the resulting cost reduction. Other common criteria for environmental measurement and monitoring are defined by Eurostat, in particular under the section \"Market Competence\", or in ISO 11134 and ISO 26000. Here, manufacturing firms can also contribute with their data and quality, since an appropriate standard is necessary to support their implementation in future ISO 17025 legislation.\\nData on market share (based on survey data) of consumer goods can contribute the data needed for defining environmental criteria. Different sources can therefore also be used, namely customer surveys, reports and business surveys. Among these, customer survey answers are most useful, because they may reveal gaps and shortcomings in consumer awareness, product development and manufacturing, quality and reliability. Their measurement provides information regarding how well consumer groups compare to each other and to potential competitors. For example,\\nwhere F i is the survey frequency and N i are total number and gender of respondent. Such as, a question which asks consumers \"who would buy a car in 2013?\" may provide answers similar to (15):\\nFurthermore, such surveys can reveal a variety of market information that may lead to more precise answers.\\nAlthough there are no direct examples of applying environmental assessment and certification criteria in SE enterprises, researchers usually make use, either directly, through their own experts, on expert recommendations from the market. However, this model is limited, not only due to time and expertise, although also to market characteristics and product requirements [5]. Therefore it may be useful to assess potential market demands and conditions by making use also of information from other experts. According to [10], there is no comprehensive study on how the assessment results of various criteria can impact SE business sustainability. One example of this is reported by Mergel [10]. This author reports studies that consider the potential problems surrounding SE market performance. He analyzes the criteria used in different areas of environmental business management. At the same time, he states that environmental aspects do not always influence market decisions, even when making the best choice at any stage of business', 'How can we promote sustainability? And just recently, the new Sustainable Cities Forum in Toronto has raised a global public awareness about the issue. The Sustainable City Forum is intended to promote sustainable city planning and implementation, and to help build a collaborative and cooperative approach.\\nThis initiative looks to build support around different sustainability issues, ranging from the construction of new facilities (e.g., water and sewer systems), to the preservation of the natural environment (i.e., forests), economic development, as well as social and environmental policies. It is possible that sustainability can also be a social issue.\\nA more positive way forward for cities and municipalities to foster strong and sustainable citizens is to encourage all stakeholders to recognize climate change and its impact on the built environment. Creating more and more sustainable partnerships is often a prerequisite to achieve the goals of sustainability and ultimately to fight against climate. Sustainable cities will have strong communities, green communities at the local level, safe and secure local environments that promote safety, quality of life and the well-being of families.\\nConclusion\\nThis article presents a brief review on emerging and already established sustainability strategies in the field of city building and sustainability. In addition to a discussion of methods, recommendations were presented in order to ensure that cities, municipal units, authorities and relevant stakeholders (city councils, local authorities, investors, social workers, citizens, etc.) can adopt the best way possible. They could also contribute to this review as they bring their recommendations in a useful format for decision making.\\nThe review showed that there are some existing and promising approaches on city sustainability in different countries. Furthermore, it shows that the most promising initiatives in emerging economies (particularly those from lower middle income countries) do not only focus on local, environmental, economic and social issues but also work towards developing a wider range of social, human and economic dimensions related to city functioning.\\nUrban sustainability is not an easy issue to understand at all in practice. Cities have to invest in policies and strategies that give public, private and third sector involvement the power and resources to make sure that their efforts work for the better. Local municipal authorities have the responsibility to develop and implement policies that align with the principles of sustainable development and that can foster local policies on sustainability, but not all efforts have succeeded. Moreover, even among local municipal bodies with a long tradition in supporting and developing sustainable cities -in Europe for instance -the role of public authorities is still not yet fully realized.', 'How should we create awareness about green energy? What is the science in this? How can our local communities develop their electricity plants to produce energy that is less polluting than what is produced?\\nA green business is a business that uses the natural resources at minimum cost. It is an approach that does not pollute. We know that green technologies are very important in our economies, yet many businesses have not realized the value of green technology in terms of savings and productivity.\\nWe must do more to increase awareness of energy efficiency, particularly in the electrical, gas, and air-conditioning companies, whose jobs depend on electricity. Green enterprises include retailers and wholesale, which would benefit from greater awareness.\\nEnergy efficiency companies could find an array of benefits as a result of better understanding and greater collaboration with local local governments. Energy efficiency strategies have helped reduce the costs of many utilities and increase the prices for new consumers. Reducing the amount of electricity in homes is more of a wasteful investment. But the savings are not always immediately obvious. For instance, energy suppliers can charge a lower price for gas than they actually use.\\nGreen companies are more effective because they can understand costs and optimize their profit. They can recognize how and when to use electricity, reduce unnecessary power consumption, save energy and reduce production costs; and they have knowledge that saves them money in time and money from legal costs.\\nMany companies have learned that saving energy, whether because buying a new home or simply keeping it all as green, improves customer service, leads to cleaner products and improves revenues. People find that energy companies and businesses collaborate more with government agencies and local landlords.\\nFor example, local government can help raise wages for local labor, thereby reducing energy costs. Local governments can manage their power grids to maintain electricity supplies and fuel costs for residential customers. These services are a good alternative to high energy consumption.', 'How should we create awareness about green energy? If we do, this is going to change the way we think about power - how we see it. Green energy becomes the future of power, and we can reduce energy consumption, conserve water and energy.', 'How should we create awareness about green energy?

Well, as a community of support groups in Liddesford, it’s hard to decide which of these choices are right for you. In fact, if you decide the latter, you might decide to set up a charity. But, to stay with the basics and get your finances in order, some of the most important things to see when looking at best charities in the area that we can recommend are the following:\\nFirst, determine if there is a charitable organization that is going to support you, the person who will be the beneficent, and you have a number of other friends and families to go by. A charitability checklist might look something like this:\\nCheck out any local community centers and the community support organizations that happen to be supporting you; these organizations will show that the organization you’re thinking about has the right people, services, community resources, etc. The list would then really be a better indication of if it’s worth the effort.\\nKeep in mind that if the local church, organization, and/or religious group you are considering is really just for the benefit of another person, then you would’ve no problem if it isn’t for that or that person. That said, sometimes when working with other people at a local, religious, or charity, they simply don’t want to accept financial support or anything else from the fundraising process. Some will just say that it’s too hard for them and that “we’re not working here, so we don’t have the capacity to contribute.” Of course there will always be someone who wants to work hard, but it will often be because they don’t realize what a much bigger world they might inhabit.\\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation, make sure that you know if your church or the group that supports you is qualified to provide your local assistance and provide you financial assistance. Ask someone to walk into your neighborhood and see if they have their local support organization with them. Most churches will need to have them be registered with any city’s county government.\\nSo, a good point when it comes to picking the best charity organization for your community or group is that there really is only a limited number and only one charity that truly fits your needs. Many of our members are not looking for religious organizations of any sort; they want simple things like cooking or a donation card. If you need help in keeping your financial health stable and your lifestyle or job stable, check out the charite for which you want.\\nOne of today’s biggest challenges for both us as business people and people in our community, in communities that love their businesses, is the impact of online commerce. Although the world has changed over the last 3 decades, traditional retail shops have changed and become the new norm. So, what is digital retail?\\nDigital retail is not simply a brand name, for example; it means everything from physical goods to digital products like digital magazines. Yes, online stores have increased in sales. However, it requires new products to create and maintain revenue levels and brand names. To be successful on the internet, stores need a variety of branded products that not only sell items, such as clothing, items of furniture and appliances, like furniture, kitchen and bath items and others, not just products of clothing or furniture.\\nFor customers, this means to make purchases in stores online through the sale of their goods or services. It means that it not even necessary to choose a store or to visit the store in person to buy, all you can do is purchase online and they will have your goods and services delivered when they are approved.\\nHere at Wealthy Affiliate or Sell By Afiliates, we always make an effort to build brand equity as we believe online sales and affiliate marketing are mutually reinforcing when it’s aligned to the overall product line of an online store. With online buyers who prefer to shop through a website and direct purchase, those things also have been doing well. As a side-effect of this, sales have also been increasing and we’re seeing better results now than we could in previous years. This, again, was a powerful impact on online purchase data, because it made things easier for consumers to get to know you and their shopping needs.\\nIt is very important to remember that what you buy online can be sold as well, meaning that your products can come back for replacement in retail locations that can not compete with online shops. It’s a win-win scenario especially for retailers that have grown their online revenue dramatically.', 'How to start an NGO to help underpriviledged people?

He was the first leader of Islam in the world, having arrived at the United Kingdom in his 60 th year as Muslim. When he crossed the border of Iraq with Kuwait, he had arrived in Baghdad already in 1292. Upon his arrival, Imam Muhammad saw his country suffering a totalitarian regime. This happened in early 1299, during the reign of Shaykh al-Malik, after the death of Abbas the Great. Imam had a deep understanding of Muslim social problems in that time. Since this was his first and, indeed, most important period of his life, in which he saw him and his followers in action, it seems that he would have written numerous books about Muhammad in particular. The Prophet Muhammad was an inspiration and a god to his Muslim followers both in terms of religious religious knowledge and economic prosperity. All Muslims who have read the book of Qur\\'an have found that Muhammad is the leader and inspiration of their lives.\\nAfter leaving the country in order to reach Western Europe, his entire family fell behind when it came to emigrating to America. Being an immigrant, however, Muhammad remained with his family for many years and helped save the lives of many people by providing some necessary provisions. One of them was Muhammad Saher, who spent the last two years of His life working as a merchant in a town in South Africa. Having been left out of this world for so long, Allah spoke to him in His own way. After being given a job as assistant to a friend in Oxford, where he was studying, He went to Paris to make a visit. According to Saheri, \"Once in Paris the next day he arrived and found his wife and three of her children dead in an undercutting car. During his search, while trying to climb out, Saheler was thrown to an unexpected tree that had fallen out in front of him. A moment later, when suffering heavy injuries, as he came out onto the trunk, she collapsed upon her mattress, dying instantly. She left one of these children alive, whose last act was to call for someone to take care of an dying mother. Sahler fell into an alley and fell off into the water in whose depths Sahere was able to swim to life\" (Al-Allamah, vol. 4, No. 27, 1979, pp. 29, 30).\\nHis own family and society were a disaster. Even his parents, son-in-law and wife, died at once. His father was sent off from school, was beaten, then thrown out as soon as the sun returned. Other family members were suffering in hospital and they lived in solitary confinement. There was no house where they were able and stable shelter for their souls in any way at all. At one place, they slept around tables on cement poles instead of beds. To this day, many of us know that while suffering, even the most hardened and courageous souls will find that the darkness in their hearts will not be as it has been for ever. Although Saherer lived at ease, not only were their parents not able for one day to provide them with food, clothing or everything they needed, some of Saher\\'s best friends were also suffering. So, what would be a life without him?\\nIn Muslim traditions regarding the people of God, Islam has always believed in Allah as Messiah. God was said to have always had the final say, despite the differences in views among Christians. However, this is far from true.

            "['Why is corruption prevelant? If so, what are its characteristics? What role does punishment play in it? Why does it work in some cases, but fail in others? We want to make some clear points on why corruption is preeminent:\\n1\\nThe nature of corruption.\\nCorruption is a social phenomena since its origin it stems from the exploitation and abuse of power from individual to individual. So, its genesis was quite natural from a psychological point of view. There are four major types of human problem: opportunism, selfishness, jealousy, and envy. The first two type of behaviours that constitute opportunistic, self-interested behaviour in human existence are exploitation as well as abuse such as oppression and domination. Opportunistic and selfish behaviour are mutually reinforcing behaviours and will not be removed or removed once they break from one another. If the human beings act opportunistically, in the best case it leads to a decline in society. In the worst case that will be a cause of social collapse. All in all, the world does not end. Exploitation alone can not replace its source. Human behaviour plays an important role in its formation. At least in India, a great part of the development of our society have been caused by opportunist, selfinteressed, evil and revengeful behaviours. This has resulted in development in terms of industrialisation, economic prosperity, power, wealth, status and prestige, which has lead to corruption. As an example, by the year 2009, 1,211 billion rupees (US$16.6 billion) has gone to corrupt actors and their families and other assets (Indian Institute of Public Policy). This is significant. Indeed, it shows that the role of corrupt in socioeconomic growth is vital.\\nThere are some general problems in our country and many people in general. Corruption exists everywhere. It is now clear from what we have said above, that corruption occurs in every corner of society for two main reasons namely, opportunism: the individual wants to exploit the power position within community to his/her profit. Then the person takes advantage of what he/she can. For example if he or she has a business or if his or her family has wealth. He/she always wants it for himself or herself. And selfish in nature. A person is always trying to change himself and his family members. They do not want an opportunity nor will they be satisfied unless the opportunity will give them a position and benefit. Thus, they look for an easy and easy way to do so which is taking advantage. Often it is the result of unintentionalness. Unfortunately it becomes obvious that it has been done consciously and is made at work with others. That is why the man or woman always comes to us and wants us to work for them, for our good. When some people are at the top, things become a bit difficult. After some years, one can see the progress made in this regard. While most of us are not interested in what is said or it was done. But as the number of people who are high no longer available is there any need to take a course, have a degree or get a job? It has brought about a problem to society as it brings bad things like lack of good workers, job security, poor wages or a lack and ineffective government, under one roof of government is like a prison. People who want wealth cannot do anything but to be rich themselves. However some want access to government and they get it. Just because a person has the ability to get the Government in Pakistan does nothing. Money is only an illusion, as a simple example. Anybody can make money or can earn some money. With the rise of money, people want power. Anyone knows how to play the game and has no problem doing that. Therefore, without any control there is no peace of mind. We have not had any peace and we are also not satisfied with our lives that are well and have family. Some may still want these things. Those who do want one thing are those who prefer not to go to any university. Such people cannot get any good job, so they either go on to higher education or work. To become unemployed, we need that money and it will come from government. What has happened in recent years in relation to our countries? Many countries have achieved better levels of national development. Recently India did not have any problems with corruption, because it did everything possible to control corruption in their country. Most government officials were good people working for the country, who were happy to help people, especially poor citizens. Also, if someone is on the bench they always try to bring more funds. One can talk about corruption and the way that some politicians do things as if they were like it or they just have no idea. How many of them are from lower classes? The same problem that arises in many countries and all the countries we spoke about. Moreover, corruption happens in both public and non-', 'Why is corruption prevelant? Do people take precautions, or do they not? What are the different factors involved in the corrupt practices and corruption in other countries, and how can we use that information to better understand what is happening in countries without corrupt laws and regulations, that is, when it comes to corruption, if we should be able to do that? The second point to note is that the corruption problem is a worldwide problem. This is because corruption is the most powerful motivation for individuals to commit crimes, the ones that cause the worst human suffering, so it makes sense that there must be a more widespread problem rather than just at the front. So why corruption?\\nWe can take the statistics of a country as a good start to studying a corruption problem: most countries have a crime rate that does not look very high at first glance. But then after a while this is changing dramatically. At the beginning, there are countries that commit only a few crimes each year and at that point the crime rates start going higher. After awhile, countries with more corruption start suffering more from the wrongdoings because there is no one in charge. That is usually where countries commit more crimes and their corruption rates begin to fall. In many cases, this kind of problem has a root of internal corruption and the system that makes the systems that are responsible for that corrupt is called an autocratsystem. It is important to understand this in order to apply prevention, recovery and rehabilitation initiatives. There is also an area where there will be an increase in corruption because of the emergence of new forms of corruption that has become rampant in this form of government. Because so many people are being forced to work under bureaucratic control, people will continue to suffer under the control of this bureaucracy, especially young people who are not able or unwilling to fight against their parents, with their education, lack of work or education and they will start working, in some cases as factory workers; some of those youngsters will even grow up as slaves and that very day will inevitably end up being a threat to the state and to their livelihood. Therefore it is very important for the government to continue its efforts on the prevention of that corruption by focusing on reducing the internal and external corruption problems where they are more effective at reducing these problems. The next point that should we focus on is how corruption can affect people.\\nCorruption is more harmful when the problem exists for a long time, because people often fail to find what they need (or they just don’t know how to earn money) or know who should do their jobs. When the public is corrupt this makes it more difficult for government workers to make their choices and this does lead to a kind type of fraud. And that fraud, which sometimes is so large that it destroys the entire community, can also result in crime. How do people look at corruption? They will have problems thinking that they should have made their choice because they actually will receive the punishment from another person or a state. A common reason for people to misinterpret the information that comes from government is people have no idea what their government really is or what the role of bureaucracies is in society. To the extent that you can actually see corruption before it occurs, even though you cannot know why it happens in a certain country, you will already know that this cannot affect your income or your life. These people understand that no government should hold back what you should really do and therefore they do not want to face the problems that come with corruption. If someone can see a problem there and then you are in control that problem, then that person will say, “I don’t wanna do it”, “It isn’t something I can fix” or “Maybe someone else will do the work”.\\nWhat does “rampant” mean? When you consider corruption as rampantly corrupt, such person cannot be trusted because because their income will not change and hence the changes in income they make to themselves will never disappear. They cannot trust anyone. Corruption is not a simple matter of being able and able not to be in place because you need time and money because if you want people or governments to respect you from time to time there needs to come changes. I don’t want corruption to ramp up and ramp out because then we will become too dependent on a single person who cannot respect each other. He has to have the ability to get things done for us on time so if he decides to take an inconvenient person and run from them, he will fall at once because the inconvenience is worse than getting his money back on his shoulders. You get to know a person, how they live, what his background is and what he thinks and thinks about him. What type they want this person to believe and do, whatever you might be doing for them. Well, it’s that simple. Yes, I know this sounds strange, but it’s true because it works. On first and second thoughts, most people would be more inclined', 'Why is corruption prevelant? Is corruption a feature of history? Was corruption the product of natural human nature? It is an entirely plausible answer to all these questions.', 'Why is AI biased to speicific race? Is AI bias to choose whichever racial group it chooses in the first place? Has AI learned to prioritize racial discrimination? Do the AI race algorithms use race as a factor and are they biased in favor of “normal human” people? Answering these questions opens up new problems for our understanding of race at the machine learning and algorithms frontier. AI’s race decisions depend heavily on previous experience with racism and what our social structure is like. With recent research showing the power of predictive statistical techniques and machine intelligence to learn how we think and behave, we can begin to make meaningful progress on these fundamental issues.\\nDoctors and scientists working on AI argue that AI is biased primarily because the social context that allows its performance is inherently biased by the human. This is very similar to the ways computers make predictions about the world around them. It is just that the environment we create has an inherent bias that will constrain us to some degree, but what humans and computers are doing right now is improving the odds of being human and therefore making AI more likely to work for human benefit.\\nWe can’t predict what an individual will choose, so our AI algorithms must take advantage of these biases to develop better predictions. As AI advancements grow in terms of computational capabilities and more information, our algorithms should not be able to predict how to treat individual health at face value. In order for an AI algorithm to perform its job, it needs to be sensitive to these factors. Of course, they also need to take into account the fact that an entire field of science is dealing with racial or other misconceptions that are just as prevalent in human communities as in other settings.\\nAs much as AI promises to improve human health, this will not always be enough to solve all our problems. If we can’t effectively address discrimination, science will continue to fail. The results from a vast amount of research conducted by health organizations and academia will show that we should invest in research on racial and racialized health rather than focusing on treating race alone.\\nOver the years, the public has become increasingly aware of the influence of a certain environment on how people process information. Researchers at MIT suggest that social environments can be an important determinant of how computer users process and interpret information through the automatic control of many different neural circuits. For example, when people receive information in a noisy environment, an automatic system adjusts information processing in response to both environmental and internal cues. Because there is little information available in an noisy and noisy world, humans process some information simply because of their noisy sensory experience. When this information is processed, some neural systems process that information and some other information that doesn’t belong to them is ignored or ignored. People who take a passive approach to dealing or treating this situation may fail to react appropriately to certain information.\\nThe most common social discrimination we have today is racism at one point in time: “Do you think a female with fair skin is more attractive than a guy with dark skin because he has darker brown eyes?\". However, as well as its impact on physical appearance, racism can also affect how humans actually treat social interactions and relationships. A study conducted at Boston College showed that people who used a racist image of racial groups (“Do more black people”, for example) or racial prejudice in speech and action were more negative (and thus, more frustrated) in some instances than people not using racial images (i.e. “people without a history”). To avoid discriminating against racists, it’s important that our human race is well-balanced before people start taking the lead on racism.\\nAlthough racism exists, most people think they have no problem. But when faced with untrusted information they’re not able or willing to deal with it. There are two types of data sets we’ve just referred to that can impact this. First, are racial disparities in productivity that should drive our race algorithm’s decision process. We needn’t worry because most research shows that discrimination that comes off a single word can still impact your experience in your workplace or in any society you belong into. Second, if we don’t have a clear discrimination history, how can we make our systems and processes fair? In fact, there are many ways by which people have racially biased experiences with our communities.', 'Why is AI biased to speicific race? Is it just a trick?\\nIn my opinion, the answer is yes as well! Humans are designed to be intelligent. It is a human trait that is not only necessary but also required by AI. Even our ancestors did not automatically learn to understand our environment, thus we have to communicate it, which is important. The problem being that we did this to preserve humanity at the expense of ourselves. This is why we are not just human anymore. Why should I give up my humanity for AI? And why should we ever give-up my life?\\nAs you have already stated, AI has the ability to artificially create us as humans for better understanding of our surroundings. In fact, a lot of people in the past have said that some of the AI that have created it could be dangerous to humans if they were truly dangerous. I was thinking of Elon Musk being a victim of this by being such a great genius in computer.\\nIf we learn from the humans who have killed someone, we can’t say that they have been malicious – they just don’t know how or why to act like such people. So one way to explain, there is no way they can do it. They cannot kill and if one tries to, they don’t willingly. Then someone tries. Not just those who are born with the natural intelligence but the human intelligence to find out what is taking place. But people cannot. Humans cannot understand other animals who we’ve created to protect us (or have done with). Humans wouldn’t have any power in those circumstances.', 'Why is AI biased to speicific race? So many, or so many of the same things we see or hear at the top universities.\\nThey are very aware of it, just not saying it has nothing to do with race itself. It is a way of making the most of race. The reason why I don’t understand that is because racism is one of our very best allies.\\nI have been thinking about race and race is just a term we use to describe someone who is different. Race is not about their race but because the other person says so. So you have to think of something bigger than whether someone is white or black. People who say they are from Asian descent cannot just say that, they get that from their environment, society. I think it’s one thing to say you are Asian-ish, you’re Muslim.\\nIt has to be more nuanced. What is it that you just do not allow a person to speak about, by showing yourself racism so you can become the subject? They can’t be in charge of people who are themselves victims of racism, because it would be hard for them to support or even be friendly with someone that they don’t know. We have so much on our side to fight for, we are not in it to take away from others.\\nWe can’t just be racist. That can’t change when there is something else happening because you cannot be black and you can’t speak, that’s not racism. You don’t speak or you don’t think and your racism doesn’t change by being that racist person. Even the racist is part of who I am.\\nWhy? Because we cannot not see each other in every way. When they talk about “weird people.” A person who’s from a certain country or religion and has a haircut and no makeup and this person gets drunk and runs and then turns around and sees that person and says she can’t relate to who she is. It’s really hard to see why we have a relationship because every day we interact with different people in different ways.\\nSo this is very, very wrong. Sometimes talking about racism at university is irrelevant because there are studies that indicate that it’s just, it’s not important.\\nWho will do that? I’m talking to students and my friend who says her hair is curly, well, she’s not, really, her natural color is dark green, so that looks like what she looks in the mirror. They might say, “Oh my God, I just didn’t see what I wanted. Like, this hair color looks horrible. How could I live with that! You’re just like a normal hair colour. And she has an entire day on her head. Or she can see a little bit of all that with a mirror and can only see the light in this mirror.\\nThe beauty of things is that we really can’t have one color in our lives. There isn’t this one. I’ve never been a fan of that.\\nBut why is someone’s hair curlier and more shaggy in a university than in an outback country? The fact is, if we look at it in general, people we’re friends with think that she actually does shiver because it’s the end result of genetics. These effects we only observe in Western culture.', 'Why are polluting industries still granted permissions?

In 2010, 1.7 billion plastic bags were produced using different materials; some were found in local sewage sludge and others had been disposed in oceans and rivers.\\nIn Bangladesh, the market for plastic has been declining since 1986. This is because the government has banned certain plastic products. The report shows that in Bangladesh the annual consumption has decreased sharply, but at a much slower rate. Since the beginning of the year, only 10 per cent of consumers in Dhaka had bought any products from home. Therefore, if consumers are to reduce their consumption of plastic they need to know the sources of this problem.\\n“The government had tried to block plastic but this was not making a difference. But in recent years there has come an increase in the number of companies selling non-recyclable plastic products”, says Dr. Nand Kherat, Director of Bioethics Division (NIB) at Dhaba Engineering College, which runs the National Institute of Biotechnology and Health (NIIBHI), a leading NGO in industry-based research in India. “We are looking to solve this issue by using industrial waste. It’s already been done by many NGOs at schools, hospitals and factories”.\\nAlso, plastic was found to be responsible for a large proportion of all deaths from all causes in China between 2001 and 2012. Many plastic-based products are also responsible by consuming more animals than plants.\\n“Some of these products have become contaminated at sea because of industrial contamination, a lot has gotten under water because there was food contaminated with these dangerous chemicals, and the plastic is getting contaminated by other toxins or chemicals from other countries before it reaches the water”.', 'Why are plastics not yet banned?

When I was a kid, I spent more time studying computer games than on the day-to-day tasks of a full-time student. I also used to feel depressed at times, and not because of the learning, the computer or anything else. For me, that was the time when I turned all the pages of my diary down on something that actually mattered like study time, time at work or time to myself, just because I did not have it in me.\n",

This is my first year cooking at home!\n",

But cooking can also help me focus on other aspects of life while having more fun learning the basics again.\n",
            "The most difficult thing to learn is how we eat. With the kitchen full of kitchen tools and everything else to make this work, it’s definitely not easy to eat right. It’s not even the case for food that’s just plain delicious.\n",

Yet, my kitchen has now gotten more sophisticated since it’s my regular daytime outlet now. I’m still learning a lot, especially through cooking and cooking with kids. However, with all that practice, cooking has become a little of both. Even the things I’m currently doing, if I do make it right, are more enjoyable than studying.\n",
            "To be fair, this process has taken a long time. Before, even though the diet was designed after school in my home, things still had to be done, like make a list of all food items to buy. Now, after I got in kindergarten, school has moved by and I haven’t been eating properly. My meals are mostly stuffed and packed with grocery items. These items just get really crowded and frustrating at the end of each meal, making it difficult for me to keep up with time requirements. While I still eat a pretty generous diet, that’s not possible anymore. When I’m tired, I’d rather get something to do and eat well, than try to focus and work hard to stay fit. As a result, food habits have become less conducive to learning.\n",

            "Response: Is radiation good for health? That is not the question. Radiation (or other forms of electromagnetic radiation) is the result of certain physical interactions with an object. The primary interest in radioisotope-based biomedicine and clinical use in radiation medicine centers is therefore based on these interactions.\n",
            "Radiation medicine is also a field of computer and communication technology (e.g., personal computers and communications networks), which can give rise or support both physical and psychological effects.\n",
            "Physical factors have been associated with the pathophysiology of radiation oncology, including damage to soft tissue structures such as bones, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. Some of these include radiation damage of breast tissue and the brain due to the impact of energy and x rays, resulting in progressive changes in the tissue structure and immune response. However, it is difficult to predict and quantify the effects of the presence of a specific kind of ion beam on the normal mammalian breast epithelium (i.e., an effect from ionizing radiation to normal breast cancer). The effects on physiology and function of lymph nodes have also been implicated, because they are the location of cell-free lymphatic drainage that is considered to be a major factor in axillary and pelvic lymph node disease (31). In addition, the frequency with which the patients receive radiation has been shown to correlate with breast radiation dose (32). However other physical factors such that can influence the breast can also contribute directly to cancer.\n",
            "As an example, radiation can cause cancerous proliferation, migration, aggregation, differentiation, or repair of cancer cells in several ways. In early, proliferating breast epithelial cells (such as breast cords), ionising radiation, in contrast to radiation from the body, may stimulate proliferation by increasing protein synthesis, which leads to cell size and therefore is an energy-driven process. Cells undergoing differentiation into a specialized cell type, such those in mammary gland and/or breast carcinoma, respond to this energy source and, once the radiation is over, repair or differentiation becomes normal. To date, there is no data that directly links the extent of radioresistance to dose to cells or to effects within the cancer microenvironment.\n",
            "There is currently no conclusive evidence that radiation therapy affects the rate of tumor recurrence in patients with invasive breast carcinomas within their axilla, pelvis, breast, and/or colon. A possible explanation for that observation might relate to a mechanism of repair as well as a potential mechanism for the progression or recurrence of residual tumor cells within these distant metastatic sites (33). It would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus for distinguishing radiation-resistant breast tumors from normal primary breast patients.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>\n",

            "Response: Is radiation good for health?\". However, the evidence for the link is scarce; in a meta-analysis of 2,184 patients the investigators found an odds ratio of about 1.5 for being irradiated for a year (1). They noted several advantages in being given a treatment against cancer. The most obvious is an increase in the length of treatment; the more time it takes, earlier the symptoms, such as local recurrences, and the worse the course (2). Most importantly, a significant increase is seen in life expectancy. This is due to the fact that radiation therapy is known to delay and eliminate any risk of cancer.\n",
            "Over the next few decades, radiation oncologists must carefully assess a patient's medical history and any additional factors that have been related to cancer risk; as opposed to considering a tumor as isolated. If a patient presents with multiple symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it is important to consider a diagnosis for additional risk factors (3) (4) (5) (6). It is now clear that cancer is a multifactorial disease with an important role for genetics, family history, smoking, environmental exposures and other co-morbidities. In addition, patients with lymphomas can be extremely high in body mass index (6, 7). These factors cannot be ignored either.\n",
            "Because patients' genes play a central role in health, genetic counselling should be strongly recommended for these patients (8). Some genetic testing systems have already been established; however, further research is required to determine what is the best and most appropriate test (9) (10) (11) (12). One of the most interesting findings in this field is that the majority of patients do not experience a benefit from genetic counseling (13) (14) (15).\n",
            "A large majority (95%) of newly diagnosed patients will receive a chemo-resistant mutant after a certain dose of radiation treatment. Another interesting finding is what usually happens when a first patient receives the same combination of anticancers and antineoplastic therapy as other patients at the time of diagnosis (16). When a cancer has been associated with a specific tumor-suppressive mutation in one of its genes, or with certain cancer cell lines, there is almost certainly a risk for tumor recurrence. Therefore, in particular with the rarity of tumor suppressive mutations, an early and accurate assessment and treatment choice remains a key issue for patients. Recent developments in genetics: first-generation whole-exome sequencing and next-generative technologies (e.g., Sequenom, Genomic Corp., San Diego, CA) permit an assessment of a large number of genes and a subsequent choice of an appropriate combination to treat each patient (17) (18) (19). The identification of putative predisposing genes that confer an increased risk will be a further way for genetic screening, but so far these methods have only been used in small numbers of cases (20). Although the effect of genetic counselling in new patients has recently been investigated (21), our results show that a majority cannot possibly develop a favorable response to therapy despite the existence of several predisposed genes.\n",
            "A genetic risk score is another approach to disease risk assessment; it can help clinicians to make a decision on the correct treatment plan in light of personal and family histories. Moreover, clinical risk scores can also be used to identify cancer patients in whom a more aggressive treatment is beneficial; this can result in an earlier diagnosis and, more importantly an improved overall prognosis (22). However for many groups, even after decades of research (23), a major barrier to their adoption (24) and their use is still the lack of guidelines on this issue.\n",

            "Response: Why is literacy important? Is literacy a thing in the past?\n",
            "In his book, “Why we don’t like language: A New Approach to Language Learning,” professor and author John J. Siegel presents the concept of “significant literature, or the value that language has for its users.”\n",
            "How can someone read? According to Josselyn McCrae, who writes about science in her book “Significant Literacy, Significant Stories” (Published by Penguin Random House), “It’s hard. The most important thing your child needs is an experience. Literate your teenager with language that makes him feel like he or she is reading. It’s also not as if it’s what the world is about. It just can be a lot better than that, with good reading habits. When you read, he’ll be thinking ‘I actually read a nice novel,’ or ‘Reading makes me think on what I’m going to write,’” McCreee says. Writing a story, as one student said, is “the best learning experience I’ve ever had” on grade level. In addition, McCreiess’ book suggests that “as we age, the number of stories we read by ourselves as young people will decrease significantly. As our skills change in accordance with age that can change the nature and value of that information. And just because a child is new to learning something, no one in our family is learning everything. For this reason, we need to read as many different stories as we are able — or even more than we have time for. Our families don’t always read the same type of story over and over. We read all sorts of different sorts just for fun, to make sure we want to repeat what we’ve read. If we already read stories long enough, it may make for a long break in this process. At this point in time, it’s essential that our kids learn what to study. Reading, for young adults, doesn’t just make them adults. While reading can make a big impact on our day-to-day lives, just one sentence could make the difference—whether that’s an article about your love life, a conversation about the upcoming holidays, an issue about a specific book in your church’s library, another essay about just getting your point across, you name it. “We’re all writers so we can do some of the writing, but when you are really into what you do, in terms of what kind of world we’re in, this can actually lead you down a path, if you choose to follow the path you want.’”\n",
            "The book explains how, since childhood, language plays a crucial role in a teen’s lives. His research examines the impact of language on young adult reading as it affects its effects on reading comprehension. He offers a comprehensive description of how language affects how a young person uses words, expressions and ideas. Many teenagers have trouble reading and are disconcertingly low in both reading fluency and comprehension when their reading abilities are weak. Even when reading is a secondary skill they struggle with.\n",
            "“I wanted to examine the importance of learning how to listen and communicate. By listening, I mean understanding what is actually said. But that doesn’t mean just saying it; it includes listening to what your target audience is saying, then moving into making judgments on it based on that. I was very interested in understanding the different ways things may sound to the adult audience. A good way to say that is to check the way the speaker’s tone looks. Are there many turns in sentences? Are people talking in different directions? Some are doing a joke to one another? A lot of their sentences are like, ‘This is how you should do it, and that’s how I think you ought to do it; this is something you can’t simply do or say.’ That was probably the first thing I needed to figure out. Then I had to consider how the sound of words is perceived from their tone. How are individuals not so loud because of a certain set of reasons? I thought what about why people would be so quiet or loud in their own language? The second thing we wanted was to understand the meaning of spoken words. People talk, they say things. They have conversations. Not every conversation is for the purpose of taking an opinion or making a judgment. That’s very important. Is there really any difference in communicating with someone who says something when they actually say something? It could not. So we started looking in those things, how people communicate in society and what type information they can learn on the table. Of course, that also needed some digging. Finally, what I’ve found is that as adults we actually tend to see things by looking at our tone in front of our eyes. Like, sometimes when we look at someone in an unfocused conversation we see their face and they’re making an upbeat comment, whereas when it looks like they really’re being unprofessional, that’s very bad for them. There’s an enormous difference\n",

However, political systems can be strengthened and strengthened by the introduction of decentralized, non-conditional rules. This was already the case in our years of democratic existence. The political integration, on its basis, brings many benefits for each member of society:\n",
            "First, economic union enables the development of industrial countries. At the end of a period, Europe becomes more integrated. With the transfer of wealth from industrialized countries to newly industrialised countries through democratic politics, the resulting economies can attract a higher proportion of foreign investment, resulting in stronger economic development. Second, new social development possibilities emerge. While some European economies do not have a high level of market integration yet, by having a certain degree of free market institutions they may be able to reach and sustain these values.\n",
            "Third, regional integration provides an international policy to address the future of individualities. According to Thomas Piketty, “European integration creates an ideological system capable of mobilizing all available resources necessary in order to achieve universal growth and poverty eradication.” It allows for the international organization of politics and politics. And thirdly, from political and economic perspectives, decentralizing may create new models of power in politics to improve democracy and the quality of governance.\n",
            "In France, after the French Revolution, centralization was achieved with the consolidation of parliamentary democracy. A democracy that was established without any ideology was made, through the constitution of 1789, a political institution. As political parties were not political entities, they had no right or power to form parties or to set their policies. On the other hand, democratic parties can, according to Pumpf, have “a greater ideologization effect on their members than ideologically unimpressive parties. To increase the ideogeneity effect, parties should give political incentives to their political members to participate in ideologic organizations and to leave political organizations in an unmistakable and effective manner. Finally, when the organization is not a purely ideogenetic process but a real economic effect of political activity, social policies can have political consequences. Political influence on the social institutions may affect economic growth.\n",
            "The result of European integration into the global economy is that it brings about the economic transformation of human societies. Europe is becoming less isolated and becoming “more economically connected” than ever. Countries such as: the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Japan join increasingly the common European market. Economic integration allows a greater amount of resources from the whole world to be transferred, and for this purpose, one has a national market or a single system of production.\n",
            "Europe is undergoing the process of EU integration. What might have become a marginal, fragmented, isolated area in 1990 of North America and Europe, may become Europe. It is a fact that since the rise of state powers that have been set up in Europe in 1991, western countries have had more autonomy than before.\n",
            "There are quite a few facts to understand the results of integration in EU countries: first, countries in which a large proportion are Europeans have more resources than countries that don't; secondly they have closer economic relations with one another than with their neighbour countries; third, with EU institutions, there is an effective and stable mechanism for monitoring European cooperation.\n",
            "EU institutions have made it possible to formulate Europe as a common market for economic, financial and technical cooperation, thus the rules of this market were more effective. Thus the countries of continental Europe now have much more independence from other countries than they were in previous economic times.\n",
            "For the first time in time, EU systems are functioning, not only on an intellectual level, but also on a practical level. Integration is being more and more implemented in countries where the importance of national cultures, traditions is very large. For example, France as its largest economy has achieved that and Germany and Luxembourg have achieved more, or equal to, their GDPs.\n",
